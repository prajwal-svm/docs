<Note>
  Arrays are the foundation of many complex data structures. Understanding
  arrays thoroughly is crucial for both coding interviews and practical software
  development.

## What is an Array?


An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Think of it as a collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Integer array
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# String array
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Accessing elements
first_number = numbers[0]  # Returns 1
second_fruit = fruits[1]   # Returns "banana"
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Integer array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// String array
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

// Accessing elements
const firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Returns 1
const secondFruit = fruits[1]; // Returns "banana"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Types of Arrays

### 1. One-Dimensional Arrays

The most basic type of array, storing elements in a linear sequence.

```python
# 1D Array
simple_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Arrays that store elements in a table-like format with rows and columns.

```python
# 2D Array (Matrix)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

## Basic Operations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access" icon="arrow-pointer">
    Retrieving an element at a specific index. Time Complexity: O(1)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Insertion" icon="plus">
    Adding an element at a specific position. Time Complexity: O(n)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deletion" icon="trash">
    Removing an element from a specific position. Time Complexity: O(n)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Finding an element in the array. Time Complexity: O(n)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Implementation Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def array_operations():
    # Initialize array
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Access - O(1)
    element = arr[0]

    # Insertion - O(n)
    arr.insert(2, 10)  # Insert 10 at index 2

    # Deletion - O(n)
    arr.pop(2)  # Remove element at index 2

    # Search - O(n)
    index = arr.index(4)  # Find index of element 4
```

```javascript JavaScript
function arrayOperations() {
  // Initialize array
  let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Access - O(1)
  let element = arr[0];

  // Insertion - O(n)
  arr.splice(2, 0, 10); // Insert 10 at index 2

  // Deletion - O(n)
  arr.splice(2, 1); // Remove element at index 2

  // Search - O(n)
  let index = arr.indexOf(4); // Find index of element 4
}
```

## Memory Representation

Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means all elements are stored one after another in memory.

### Memory Calculation

<Card title="Memory Usage Formula">
  Total Memory = Size of Each Element × Number of Elements Example: - Integer
  Array (4 bytes each) with 5 elements - Total Memory = 4 × 5 = 20 bytes
</Card>

## Time Complexity

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Access Operations">
    - Random Access: O(1) - Sequential Access: O(n)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search Operations">
    - Linear Search: O(n) - Binary Search (sorted array): O(log n)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insertion Operations">
    - At beginning: O(n) - At end: O(1) - At specific index: O(n)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deletion Operations">
    - From beginning: O(n) - From end: O(1) - From specific index: O(n)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

<Check>Random access in O(1) time</Check>
<Check>Cache-friendly due to memory locality</Check>
<Check>Simple and easy to use</Check>
<Check>Base for many other data structures</Check>

### Disadvantages

<Cross>Fixed size (in static arrays)</Cross>
<Cross>Insertion and deletion are expensive</Cross>
<Cross>Wasted memory if size is overestimated</Cross>
<Cross>Contiguous memory requirement</Cross>

## Best Practices

### Do's

- Use arrays when you need constant-time access
- Pre-allocate space if size is known
- Consider using dynamic arrays for flexible size
- Use proper error handling for index access

### Don'ts

- Don't use arrays for frequent insertions/deletions
- Avoid oversizing static arrays
- Don't ignore index out of bounds checks
- Don't mix different data types (in typed languages)

<Note>
  Remember: Arrays are fundamental to computer science and form the basis for
  many other data structures. Understanding arrays thoroughly will help you
  master more complex data structures and algorithms.
